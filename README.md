I just built a fully functional JavaScript Kanban Board App, and this project helped me understand JavaScript in a much deeper way.

 Here’s what I implemented:
Dynamic DOM manipulation for creating and managing tasks
Drag & Drop functionality to move tasks between columns
LocalStorage integration so tasks remain saved even after reload or closing the app
Modal popup to add new tasks smoothly
Task count updates for each column in real-time
Delete functionality to remove tasks anytime
Fully responsive UI for all screen sizes
Clean and structured JavaScript code flow
